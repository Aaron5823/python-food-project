Dining Simulation
This Python script simulates the dining experience for multiple parties, considering various factors such as the number of people, waiting time, ordering time, cooking time, serving time, and dessert-related activities.

Simulation Details
For each party, the script generates random values for different phases of dining based on the number of people in the party.
The simulation includes waiting time to be seated, time for the server to arrive and take orders, cooking time for the food, serving time, and time for the party to eat.
If the party orders dessert, additional time for dessert-related activities is considered.
The total time spent by the party from arrival to departure is calculated and stored in a list.
The script prints the details for each trial and provides an average dining time for all parties in the simulation.
It also generates a simple plot indicating trials where the dining time exceeds a certain threshold.
How to Run
Execute the Python script using a Python interpreter:

Input
The script prompts the user to enter the number of people in the party for each simulation trial.

Output
The script generates output for each simulation trial, including the time spent in each phase, and a summary of average dining time among all parties in the simulation.

Visualization
The script provides a visual representation in the form of a plot, indicating trials where the dining time exceeds 65 minutes.
